# Socrata Reporting

This repo stores scripts for publishing metadata about public and private datasets stored on the [open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/). This metadata is stored in a separate [dataset](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Data-and-Technology-Services-Datasets/28ys-ieqv/about_data).

Inspired by the City of Chattanooga's [data inventory](https://www.chattadata.org/Government/City-of-Chattanooga-Data-Inventory/wuph-stbt/about_data).
